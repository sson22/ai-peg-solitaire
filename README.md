# ai-peg-solitaire

University Project: AI Solver for Peg Solitaire using Graph search Algorithm in C language. 

Peg Solitaire is one of the classic board game puzzles, and several boards that differ in shape and size appeared through time.
The player can move a peg jumping on top of another adjacent peg, if there is a free adjacent cell to land. There are 4 valid jumps: Left, Right, Up and Down.
The objective is to clean the board until there is only 1 peg left. Some variants require that the last remaining peg sits on the middle of the board. In this game we ignore that variant and win the game if only 1 peg is left, no matter its final position. An AI agent or human player can chose the sequence of jumps to win the game.

The project aims to find the path leading to the best solution using Graph Search Algorithm.
